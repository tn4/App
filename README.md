# App
Need 2 file made in the same directory as the running file.
-students.txt
-times.txt
Used netbean to run this code, and then compress to make the JAR file. Still need 2 txt file in the same file directory.

Logs- contains the code that record every movement of the user and record it in log.txt, still being made. <----- Need work that somehow make the jList autoscroll when an event is made.

dataframe - contains the code that allow the user to see the amount of hour each students has done <--- Finished, unless we can find a way to round the decimal number to max 3 digis. Examples > 1.212

signin - contains the code that does everything. The user must select a student and sign in, and sign out, and pressed record to actually have the hour recorded in the times.txt <--- most broken part where it a mess everywhere, it be awesome if we have a button where we can add a student. And also need to auto record the data when closed.
